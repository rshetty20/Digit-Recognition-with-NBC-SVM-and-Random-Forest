# Digit-Recognition-with-NBC-SVM-and-Random-Forest

The data set comes from the Kaggle Digit Recognizer competition.
Goal : To recognize digits 0 to 9 in handwriting images. 
Because the original data set is large, a systematic sampling method has been applied
to sample 10% of the data by selecting the 10th, 20th examples and so on. 
Construct prediction models using multiple machine learning algorithms that we have learned recently:
naive Bayes, random forest and SVM algorithms.
Tune their parameters to get the best model (measured
by cross validation) and compare which algorithms provide better model for this task and provide some
interpretations about such performance comparison results.
